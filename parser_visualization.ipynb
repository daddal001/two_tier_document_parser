       "classification algorithms. While other dimension reduction methods such as Autoencoder and Variational\n",

    "This notebook demonstrated:\n",
    "- ✅ Health checks for both parser services\n",
    "- ✅ Fast parser (PyMuPDF4LLM) for ultra-fast text extraction\n",
    "- ✅ Accurate parser (MinerU) for high-quality multimodal extraction\n",
    "- ✅ Visualization of markdown, images, tables, and formulas\n",
    "- ✅ Performance comparison between parsers\n",
    "- ✅ Export results to JSON and markdown files\n",
